## 📅 Day X: AI Video Editor Project - Daily Progress

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. 🎧 Mic & Upload Audio in Gradio Interface

* Integrated mic and upload audio support using Gradio
* Handled conversion to WAV and error handling
* Live status updates for model loading, conversion, transcription
* Fixed bugs related to variable assignment and `status_callback`

#### 2. 📄 Prompt Generator Now Supports Aspect Ratio

* Updated `text_to_image_prompt.py`:

  * User can now select aspect ratio:

    * 1. YouTube (1280x720)
    * 2. Instagram Post (1080x1080)
    * 3. Shorts/Reels (720x1280)
    * 4. Custom input
  * Width and height are stored in the `image_prompts.json`

#### 3. 💻 Colab Image Generation Updated

* `generate_images.ipynb` now:

  * Reads width/height per image from `image_prompts.json`
  * Enforces size divisibility by 8 for SDXL compatibility
  * Supports dynamic image sizes (16:9, 1:1, 9:16, custom)
  * Uses SDXL and prints visual confirmation of size per image
* Encountered GPU OOM error, resolved with session restart
