## 🔊 Day 4 Progress Notes – Whisper + Translation + JSON Export

### ✅ Tasks Completed:

1. **🎙️ Mic and File Input Modes**

   * Allowed user to choose between microphone input or audio file input.
   * Mic input now supports `s` to start and `r` to stop recording.

2. **🔁 Audio Conversion for File Mode**

   * Used `pydub` to convert any file format (e.g., `.mp3`, `.m4a`) to `.wav` for Whisper.

3. **🧠 Whisper Integration**

   * Upgraded to Whisper `small` model for improved accuracy.
   * Forced `language='te'` (Telugu) to avoid wrong script detection like Tamil/Arabic/Vietnamese.

4. **🌐 Translation**

   * Used `googletrans` to detect language and translate only Telugu segments into English.
   * Skipped translation for already English segments.

5. **📄 Output Files Saved**

   * `transcript.txt` → original text with timestamps
   * `translated.txt` → Telugu-to-English translations
   * `transcript.json` → structured JSON file with start, end, original, and translated text

6. **🧹 Clean-up**

   * Automatically deleted temporary mic recordings after transcription.

### 🛠️ Improvements Made:

* Fixed mic input bug by replacing blocking wait with chunked buffer recording.
* Improved language handling accuracy by removing Whisper's auto-detection for this case.

### ⏭️ Pending / Next Steps (Day 5+):

* Use `transcript.json` as input for:

  * AI image generation (each translated segment → image prompt)
  * Timeline-based video editing
* Add speaker diarization or silence detection (optional)
* Build a small UI or CLI preview for transcript+translation

### 📦 All code pushed to GitHub ✅
