# 🗓️ Day 9 – AI-Powered Video Editor Progress Log

## ✅ Summary

On Day 9, I focused on upgrading the image generation pipeline to improve quality, modularity, and video output integration. Here's what I achieved:

---

## 🎨 Image Generation Upgrades

- ✅ Switched from `Stable Diffusion v1.4` to **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)** for better quality and detail.
- ✅ Enabled **custom resolution support** (e.g., 1024×576 for YouTube landscape).
- ✅ Added **manual control over inference steps** with interactive prompt.
- ✅ Batch generated images from `image_prompts.json` in Colab.
- ✅ Zipped and downloaded the image folder to local system.

---

## 🧠 Intelligent `generate_images.py`

- ✅ Modified `generate_images.py` to:
  - Ask: “Have the images already been generated?”
  - Skip generation if "yes"
  - Always create a synced `final_output.json` for video
- ✅ Ensures that image → video pipeline can be re-run independently
- ✅ JSON entries include:
  - image path
  - start & end time per image (e.g., 3 seconds each)
  - optional translated text placeholder

---

## 🎬 Final Video Generation

- ✅ Used `combine_results.py` to:
  - Apply transitions (fade, crossfade, etc.)
  - Add optional text overlays (captions)
  - Add background or voiceover audio
  - Export a final `final_video.mp4` using MoviePy
- ✅ Verified correct image path handling and successful video creation.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Stable Diffusion XL greatly improves visual fidelity
- Custom step/resolution control allows better creative direction
- Separating generation and syncing logic improves reusability

Let me know if you want me to auto-format this into your GitHub `README.md`, or prep a combined daily log. Ready to close Day 9! ✅
