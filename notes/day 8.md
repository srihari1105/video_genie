# 🧠 Day 8 – Advanced Video Rendering Features with MoviePy

On Day 8 of my AI-powered video editor journey, I focused on making the video generation more professional and flexible by adding **user-controlled customization features**.

## ✅ What I Achieved Today

### 🎞️ 1. Aspect Ratio Selection
Users can now select from:
- `1:1` (Square – Instagram)
- `16:9` (Landscape – YouTube)
- `9:16` (Portrait – Shorts/Reels)

📌 This ensures the generated video is optimized for the platform it’s meant for.

---

### 📝 2. Text Overlay Enhancements
- Users can now choose **where the text appears**: `top` or `bottom`.
- The overlay is placed on a **semi-transparent black background** for better visibility regardless of the image.
- Auto-scaling of text width to fit screen neatly.

---

### 🎬 3. Transition Effects Between Clips
I added support for smooth transitions between image clips:
- `fade`
- `crossfade`
- `slide`
- `zoom`
- `none`

🌟 Transitions are **optional** and users can set the **transition duration** as they prefer.

---

### 🛠️ 4. Bug Fixes & Compatibility
- Resolved `Image.ANTIALIAS` deprecation error in newer Pillow versions.
- Fixed ImageMagick integration issue on Windows (`SyntaxWarning` due to backslashes).
- Code now runs smoothly in Windows terminals and VS Code terminal.

---

## 🗂️ Updated Script
- `generate_video.py`: Fully refactored to support aspect ratio, overlay position, transitions, and improved layout logic.

⚠️ **Note**: This is a learning journey. Please don’t clone or replicate this until I finish the complete version. I’ll open-source the final build after completion.
