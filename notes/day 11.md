## ✅ AI Video Editor Project: Day 11 Progress Notes

### 🔧 Today's Focus: Colab Backend Automation + Prewarm Optimization

Today was a key step in polishing the image generation workflow by automating the Colab backend and reducing model loading delays.

---

### 🔄 Key Improvements:

1. **Created `trigger_colab_backend.py`**

   * Uploads `image_prompts.json` to Google Drive
   * Opens Colab with `inference_steps` parameter pre-filled

2. **Built Utility Modules in `/utils`**

   * `colab_drive_uploader.py`: Handles file upload to Google Drive
   * `colab_launcher.py`: Constructs parameterized Colab links

3. **Added Prewarm Option in `app.py`**

   * Begins model loading in the background **right after transcription**
   * Reduces wait time when Colab is actually launched for image generation

4. **Refactored App Interface**

   * Rearranged Gradio blocks: Prompt generation now placed **after transcription**, improving UX

---

### 🧪 Tested and Verified

* Verified working prewarm flow
* Colab opens with correct parameters
* Uploaded notebook runs and generates correctly sized images

---

### ⏭️ What’s Next (Day 12 Plan)

* Finalize `generate_images.ipynb` with auto-drive loading + cleanup
* Integrate `final_output.json` + video generation into web app
* Wrap full audio-to-video pipeline inside interface

---

### ✅ Completed Tasks Today

* [x] Moved `text_to_image_prompt.py` to root
* [x] Added dynamic `width` and `height` to each image prompt
* [x] Regenerated and refactored `utils/` modules
* [x] Hooked Colab trigger + prewarm into Gradio app
* [x] Verified end-to-end trigger works

---

### 🚀 Project Status: \~85% Complete

> Only final polishing + UX flow + final video assembly left

---

### 🌟 Highlight: First time the app can auto-trigger Colab to generate AI images in background, with aspect-ratio support!

**Day 11 ✅ | Building an AI Video Editor from Scratch**

Today I worked on making the image generation workflow smoother and faster. I:

* Automated Colab backend with `trigger_colab_backend.py`
* Created utility modules for Drive upload and Colab launch
* Added "prewarm" functionality to load SDXL model right after audio transcription
* Improved the Gradio interface for better UX

Now, with a single button click, the app uploads prompts and opens Colab with everything ready — saving minutes every time. This brings me one big step closer to completing the full AI video creation pipeline!

🚨 Tomorrow's Goal: Finalize auto image generation + connect video generation

⚠️ Note: This is a learning journey. Please don’t clone or replicate this until I finish the complete version. I’ll open-source the final build after completion.
