[0.00s - 7.92s] title, The Shadow of Kalbharov. In the heart of Kashi, a sacred temple-hidden dark secret.
[7.92s - 14.32s] Legend spoke of a warrior priest named Rudra. Chosen by Lord Kalbharo himself to protect
[14.32s - 22.08s] the city from evil forces. One Stomy Knight, As the sky cracked with thunder. A rogue cult
[22.08s - 28.64s] called Tamasi tried to unleash a forbidden weapon buried beneath the temple. The Trinitra,
[28.64s - 36.40s] an ancient relic said to destroy time itself. Rudra, wielding a trident blessed by the gods,
[36.40s - 42.88s] emerged from the shadows, with blazing speed and divine rage. He battled masked warriors
[42.88s - 49.36s] through the rain-soaked hallies of the old city. As the cult reached the inner sanctum,
[49.36s - 56.08s] Rudra chanted mantras that summoned a fiery aura. He fought the cult leader, who had merged
[56.08s - 63.28s] with dark energy. In a spectacular clash of light and shadow. In the end, Rudra hurled his
[63.28s - 70.32s] trident into the heart of darkness. Sealing the weapon forever, exhausted but victorious,
[70.32s - 78.08s] he vanished before dawn. His oath fulfilled, since that day, the people say, when darkness rises
[78.08s - 80.64s] in Kashi. A shadow returns.
