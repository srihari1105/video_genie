 Title: The Shadow of Kaal Bhairav
In the heart of Kashi, a sacred temple hid a dark secret. Legend spoke of a warrior priest named Rudra, chosen by Lord Kaal Bhairav himself to protect the city from evil forces.

One stormy night, as the sky cracked with thunder, a rogue cult called Tamasi tried to unleash a forbidden weapon buried beneath the temple — the Trinetra, an ancient relic said to destroy time itself.

Rudra, wielding a trident blessed by the gods, emerged from the shadows. With blazing speed and divine rage, he battled masked warriors through the rain-soaked alleys of the old city.

As the cult reached the inner sanctum, Rudra chanted mantras that summoned a fiery aura. He fought the cult leader, who had merged with dark energy, in a spectacular clash of light and shadow.

In the end, Rudra hurled his trident into the heart of darkness, sealing the weapon forever. Exhausted but victorious, he vanished before dawn, his oath fulfilled.

Since that day, the people say — when darkness rises in Kashi, a shadow returns.
